# Hunnustore.mn UX/UI Redesign Concept

## User Flow Snippet
1. **Discovery** – Altan enters the homepage, uses the hero search bar to type "smart lighting" and sees curated results in the "Highlighted Ecosystems" module.
2. **Compatibility Check** – On the smart light product card, she hovers to reveal key icons and clicks through to the PDP where the "Works With" drawer defaults to Google Home, confirming seamless integration.
3. **Bundling** – Encouraged by the "Build Your Ecosystem" widget, she adds the smart light, a recommended Google Home-compatible smart plug, and a motion sensor to her cart with a displayed bundle savings summary.

## Homepage Wireframe Description
1. **Adaptive Announcement Bar** – Thin charcoal strip with rotating micro-copy (shipping offers, installation services) and compact icon toggles for language and account.
2. **Immersive Hero Module** – Full-width imagery of a modern Mongolian living room; layered text communicates "Seamless Living, Empowered by Technology" alongside two CTAs ("Shop Ecosystems" in warm terracotta, "Explore Starter Kits" in outline). Background subtly shifts via parallax on scroll.
3. **Smart Navigation Rail** – Sticky global navigation with mega-menu hover states. Categories such as Smart Home and Entertainment expand into room- and solution-based columns, plus direct links to compatibility guides.
4. **Personalized Discovery Strip** – Carousel of modular cards presenting ecosystems (Google, Apple, Samsung). Each card displays compatibility badges and quick access to curated bundles.
5. **Featured Starter Kits Grid** – Three horizontal cards spotlight ready-to-install room packages, with visual snapshots, key benefits, setup difficulty meters, and an "Add Bundle" CTA.
6. **Editorial Insight Module** – Split layout: left features latest buying guides, right highlights an explainer video on smart home basics. Designed to position Hunnustore as an authority.

## Product Detail Page Wireframe Description
1. **Top Ribbon** – Breadcrumb navigation, key trust badges, and a compact "Setup Difficulty" meter (1–5 scale with descriptive labels from "Plug & Play" to "Advanced").
2. **Hero Section** – Left: interactive gallery with product-in-context imagery and a "View in Your Room" AR callout button. Right: product title, short benefit-focused description, price, availability, and a prominent terracotta "Add to Cart" button with secondary "Build Your Ecosystem" CTA.
3. **Compatibility Stack** – Directly below the summary, a horizontal list of ecosystem badges. Clicking an ecosystem filters specs, accessories, and content to display only relevant information.

## Visual Mood Board Description
- **Palette** – Base of soft charcoal (#1D1F21) and clean white (#FFFFFF) with terracotta accent (#C7683A) for primary CTAs and highlight dividers. Secondary accent in muted sage (#4E6B5A) for informative badges.
- **Typography** – Headings set in a geometric sans-serif (Sofia Pro/Gilroy) for a contemporary, confident voice; body copy in Inter for legibility at all sizes. Use generous letter-spacing and line height to communicate calm sophistication.
- **Buttons & Components** – Primary buttons with terracotta fill, rounded 6px corners, and subtle drop shadow hover lift. Secondary buttons outlined in charcoal with 0.3s fill transition.
- **Imagery** – High-resolution photography showcasing products integrated into warm, minimalist Mongolian interiors. Light overlays and gradient fades connect modules.
- **Iconography & Micro-interactions** – Custom line icons with 1.5px strokes, paired with hover states that animate via gentle scale or color shift. Product cards feature soft shadow lifts and quick color swipes to preview finishes.

## Key Feature Justification
The "Works With" ecosystem filter removes friction for time-poor professionals by surfacing only compatible products, instilling confidence and decreasing return risk. The "Setup Difficulty" meter sets expectations upfront, empowering both tech-forward users and smart-home beginners to self-select products that fit their comfort level, thus reinforcing trust and reducing support overhead.
